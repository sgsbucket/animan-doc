The invitation email is sent by a Studio administrator. If you did not get the email or the email was accidentally lost, please ask an administrator from your Studio to send it again.

## How to Send Invitation Email

To send an invitation email, an Administrator can open the "Members" tab on the Profile page, where there is an "Invite Member" button at the bottom of the page.
