---

Renderman is a companion app to Animan that runs on a PC of your studio.
It helps render the thumbnails, animations of the Resources that you upload to Animan.

Renderman currently support rendering animations of ToonBoom Harmony as the .xstage file,
and Animate as the .fla file.

### ToonBoom Harmony

version: Harmony17 and up

Note that Animan requires a single file for upload. Harmony creates a folder for each project. To prepare a Toon Boom Harmony asset for upload, first locate the folder that contains the .xstage file for that asset, and then compress the entire folder into a .zip.  That .zip is what should be uploaded to Animan.
