title: Why checkout is important
---

When a member is assigned to work on a shot or a resource,
it is important to check out the file before downloading the file to work on it.

When a shot (or a resource) is checked out, no other member can upload
new versions to the shot (or the resource). This insures that the member
work only on the latest version.

Once the work is done, upload the new version to the shot (or the resource),
the system will check in the shot (or the resource) automatically, so other
member can take over to work on the next stage.
