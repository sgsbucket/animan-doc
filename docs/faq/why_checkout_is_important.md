title: Why is checking out important?
---

When a Member is assigned work on a Shot or a Resource, it is important to check out the file before downloading the file to work on it.

When a Shot (or a Resource) is checked out, no other Member can upload new versions to the Shot (or the Resource). This ensures that the Member is working on the latest version.

Once the work is done, upload the new version to the Shot (or the Resource), the system will check in the shot (or the Resource) automatically, so other Members can work on the next stage.
